 * MOBI6 (PalmDOC-era Mobipocket) files store their content as one big PalmDOC/LZ77- or uncompressed-text
 * blob, split across fixed-size records, plus separate image records - not a zip of XHTML files like EPUB.
 * Rather than teach the renderer a second container format, this does a one-shot transcode: decompress the
 * text into a single "OEBPS/content.html" and re-package it (plus any embedded images) as a minimal, valid
 * EPUB zip. From that point on the book is opened exactly like any other EPUB - no changes needed anywhere
 * else in the reading pipeline.
 *
 * Not supported (returns false): KF8/AZW3 (the newer hybrid format - a different, much more complex
 * container), HUFF/CDIC-compressed text (rare; used mostly for dictionaries), and DRM-protected books.
