# Inx

Reimagined. Improved. Simplified.

Inx Pro is a community firmware for Seeed Studio's reTerminal Sticky e-paper reader. It is focused on a cleaner reading experience, better EPUB support, native image rendering, SD-card fonts, and practical device tools.

*This project is a fork of CrossPoint and is not affiliated with Seeed Studio.*

- **Fonts**: build SD-card font packs from TTF/OTF files and upload them to `/fonts`.
- **Settings**: edit system settings, reader settings, Wi-Fi networks, KOReader settings, and OPDS servers.

## Desktop EPUB Thumbnails

`scripts/generate_epub_thumbnails.py` embeds a sharp `META-INF/thumbnail.jpg` in an EPUB. The reader copies this
225×340 maximum thumbnail instead of decoding and resizing the cover on the device.

It requires Python 3 and Pillow once:

```sh
python3 -m pip install Pillow
```

macOS: double-click `scripts/generate_epub_thumbnails.command` and drag an EPUB or books folder into the prompt.
Windows: run `scripts/generate_epub_thumbnails.bat` and drag an EPUB or books folder into the prompt.

By default the tool creates `Book.thumbnail.epub` beside each original. To replace originals atomically, use:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_epub_thumbnails.py /path/to/books --recursive --in-place
```

## Dictionary

Inx supports EPUB dictionary lookup with StarDict dictionaries stored on the SD card.

You can download a ready-to-use dictionary pack here:

[Download dictionary pack](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N7aUdO93xyO8Cvgr_u2sX5-dJ_a-piCK/view?usp=sharing)

To install a dictionary:

1. Download and extract the dictionary pack.
2. Copy the extracted dictionary folder to `/dictionaries/` on the SD card.
3. Make sure the dictionary folder directly contains `.ifo`, `.idx`, and `.dict` files.
4. On the device, open **Sync/Device Management page -> Choose dictionary** and select the dictionary.

Example SD-card layout:

```text
/dictionaries/
  English/
    dictionary.ifo
    dictionary.idx
    dictionary.dict
```

Only uncompressed `.dict` files are supported. Compressed `.dict.dz` dictionaries are not supported/must be uncompressed.

## Fonts

Inx includes built-in **Atkinson Hyperlegible** and **ChareInk** reader fonts.

You can also install fonts on the SD card:

```text
/fonts/
  MyFont/
    Regular_10.bin
    Regular_12.bin
    Regular_14.bin
    Bold_14.bin
    Italic_14.bin
    BoldItalic_14.bin
```

The web font manager converts TTF/OTF files into the `.bin` format used by the reader. Regular is required; bold, italic, and bold italic are optional.

The device **Settings -> Reader -> Font Manager** lists the static ZIP catalog from the [`inx-font`](https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx-font) repository. Each font is available as a `1-bit` and `2-bit` pack. Select a pack to download it; the compiled files are extracted into `/fonts/<family> <variant>/` and become available in Reader presets. Packs are limited to 5 MB.

## Custom Sleep Images

Put sleep images on the SD card:

```text
/sleep/
  image1.bmp
  image2.jpg
  image3.png

/sleep.bmp
/sleep.jpg
/sleep.jpeg
```

You can choose a fixed sleep image from settings, or let the device pick one randomly.

## Cache

Inx uses SD-card cache files to save RAM and speed up repeated work.

Main cache locations:

```text
/.metadata/       EPUB metadata, layout, progress, stats, annotations
/.metadata/xtc/   XTC / XTCH metadata and progress
/.system/cache/   Display and image cache
/.system/         Settings, TXT cache, and system data
/fonts/           SD-card reader fonts
/dictionaries/    StarDict dictionaries for EPUB lookup
/sleep/           Custom sleep images
```

You can clear cache from **Settings -> Actions -> Delete Cache**.

Deleting `/.metadata` will force EPUB layout data to be rebuilt.

## Installing

### Build prerequisites

- PlatformIO Core (`pio`) or VS Code with PlatformIO.
- A USB data cable or the appropriate programming dock/adapter for the device.
- The repository cloned with its submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx-pro
cd inx-pro
```

If the repository was cloned without submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Seeed reTerminal Sticky

The Sticky is flashed through its USB-C UART bridge. Build and upload the Sticky target:

```sh
pio run -e sticky
pio run -e sticky -t upload
```

If PlatformIO does not select the port automatically, specify it explicitly:

```sh
pio run -e sticky -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX
```

The Sticky monitor uses the same serial connection:

```sh
pio device monitor -e sticky
```

### Xteink X4 Pro

The X4 Pro is programmed through its pogo-pin dock or exposed programming adapter. It uses the native USB-Serial-JTAG port, commonly shown as `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX` on macOS.

Build the X4 Pro target:

```sh
pio run -e x4pro
```

For a first install or when replacing the complete firmware, use the full-image target. It writes the bootloader, partitions, OTA metadata, and application together:

```sh
pio run -e x4pro -t flashall --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

For normal application uploads, use:

```sh
pio run -e x4pro -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

The merged factory image is also written to:

```text
.pio/build/x4pro/firmware.factory.bin
```

The X4 Pro may briefly disappear and re-enumerate during reset. If the port changes, run `pio device list` and use the newly enumerated port.

### Web Flash

For a complete browser-based installation, use the target's `firmware.factory.bin` image with the [Inx Pro web flasher](https://github.com/obijuankenobiii/inx-web). The factory image is intended for a blank or recovery flash because it includes the bootloader, partition table, OTA metadata, and application.

For an OTA update from an already-running Inx Pro installation, use the target's `firmware.bin` release asset instead.

Tagged GitHub releases publish two device-specific images:

```text
sticky.bin  <- Sticky firmware.factory.bin (complete factory/browser-flasher image)
x4pro.bin   <- X4 Pro firmware.bin (application/OTA image)
```

To return the Sticky to official firmware, use the recovery or boot-partition instructions in Seeed's [reTerminal Sticky documentation](https://www.seeedstudio.com/sticky/docs/).

## Development

### Requirements

- PlatformIO Core (`pio`) or VS Code with PlatformIO.
- Python 3.8 or newer.
- USB-C cable.
- SDL2 for simulator builds.

### Build

```sh
pio run -e sticky
# or
pio run -e x4pro
```

### Flash

```sh
pio run -e sticky -t upload
# or
pio run -e x4pro -t flashall --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

### Web Assets

The firmware embeds the HTML and JS from `src/network/html` and `data/js`.

```sh
python3 scripts/build_html.py
```

`pio run` also regenerates these files before compiling.

### Simulator

Inx includes two native simulator targets based on the CrossPoint simulator.

For the full SDL/device UI simulator:

```sh
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SD=./fs_ pio run -e simulator -t run_simulator
```

For dashboard-only testing:

```sh
CROSSPOINT_SIM_SD=./fs_ pio run -e simulator_web -t run_simulator
```

The simulator stores its SD-card data in the folder passed through `CROSSPOINT_SIM_SD`. The firmware web server is exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` when the simulated device starts a hotspot or local network server.

On macOS, SDL2 is required:

```sh
brew install sdl2
```

For more simulator details, see the [CrossPoint simulator project](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-simulator).

### Serial Debugging

Install the monitor dependencies:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pyserial colorama matplotlib
```

Run the monitor:

```sh
# Linux
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# macOS example
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem2101
```
