/**
 * @file BookState.h
 * @brief Public interface and types for BookState.
 *
 * Per-book favorite/reading/finished flags for the whole library, persisted at
 * /.metadata/books.bin. Unlike the old design, nothing is cached in RAM between calls - every method
 * opens the file, does exactly the read/scan/write it needs, and closes it before returning. A full
 * library's worth of Book records (each with a path string, plus title/author for the small subset
 * that's favorited or currently reading) held resident for the app's whole session was the single
 * biggest avoidable RAM cost on boot; trading that for an on-disk scan per call is worth it since
 * every call site here is already either user-action-triggered or memoized by its own caller (e.g.
 * the library page's book-state cache, never a per-frame hot path.
