/**
 * @file SavedDictionaryWords.h
 * @brief Persistent list of dictionary words (with their looked-up definition) the user chose to
 *        save while reading.
 *
 * One small file per saved word under kDir, rather than a single growing blob - appending a save is
 * then just "write one new file" with no need to hold every previously-saved definition in RAM to
 * rewrite a shared file (a scholarly dictionary entry can be up to kMaxDefinitionLen bytes, so a
 * single shared file holding kMaxWords of them would be far too large to keep resident on the
 * ESP32-C3). load() only reads each file's word (a few bytes) to build the in-RAM list; the
 * definition itself is read from disk on demand via definitionAt(), same formatted HTML text that was
 * shown at save time - see EpubDictionaryUi::saveCurrentWord().
